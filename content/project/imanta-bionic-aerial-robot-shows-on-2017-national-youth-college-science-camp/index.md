The manta ray (Manta birostis) is a giant ray found in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters and have been found to weigh as much as 3 tonnes \[3]. Mantas propel through water by moving their pectoral fins in a wing-like fashion, which drives water backwards. The oscillatory swimming strokes of the manta ray have been studied by Fish et al. \[4]. Wang et al. \[5]Â studied the hydrodynamic performance of a manta ray-inspired underwater glider which displayed significant improvements in lift-to-drag ratios compared to a conventional underwater glider. However, manta ray-inspired designs have seldom been researched for applications in MAVs.

The current effort is focused on improving the aerodynamic characteristics of the base Zimmerman planform by providing bio-inspired modifications, thereby allowing it to be used for a wider range of applications.
