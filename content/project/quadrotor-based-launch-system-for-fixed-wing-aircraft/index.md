# Abstract


Missions for long-endurance fixed-wing aircraft have been limited by an inability to take off from constricted spaces. Although vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts can hover, take off, and land vertically without relying on a runway, they usually present less aerodynamic efficiency, duration of flight, and carrying capacity because they carry additional motors, batteries and propellers. Therefore, we developed a multicopter-based launch system for fix-wing aircrafts to provide them with a VTOL capability. The fix-wing aircraft to be launched is attached to the underside of the system by the ground crew. The launch system then carries the attached aircraft up into the air. Once at a sufficient altitude, the launch system revs its engines up to a certain speed and then releases the attached aircraft by ejection system. After the release, the launch system returns to the ground crew. Finally, the aircraft can be recovered by a parachute after conducting the task. The multicopter-based launch system can enhance the capability of fix-wing aircrafts to take off from complex terrain.
