I extended my research into the realm of rescue robots under Prof. Tianmiao Wangâ€™s guidance after recognizing the convenience and advancement robots might provide to help people in dangerous situations. I led a team to develop a terrain-adaptive aerial robot based on the four-legged landing gear. In addition to project management, my work also included ensuring the strength and light weight of the structure by optimization design, and adopting the strategy of hybrid position/force control to realize fast and smooth adaption. With more than a year of hard work, the prototypes were tested extensively in steep and uneven terrain environments, and a paper was published by us at an international conference in Japan. This was my first holistic research experience, and the programme not only enhanced my collaboration skills, but also inspired my desire to pursue mechanical engineering as an academic field of study.
