abstract: With the research on mental health, rehabilitation training and other
  fields, obtaining people's real emotion feelings is frequently required in
  many fields. Emotion recognition method based on physiological signals can
  directly obtain people's emotion states and avoid pretending expression and
  emotional expression disorder. In physiological signals, Electroencephalogram
  (EEG) signal is commonly used in the emotion evaluation, and Heart Rate
  Variability (HRV) signal is related to people's excited feeling. This paper
  proposed an emotion recognition method based on EEG and HRV to do the emotion
  recognition work. This method aims to solve the accuracy problem of instant
  emotion recognition, and achieve a higher accuracy. According to Russell's
  model of emotion, the system in this paper use two dimensions, “valence” and
  “arousal”, to describe people's emotion. The emotion recognition system we
  proposed combines more advanced neural network models and eigenvalues closely
  related to emotional states. This system uses DenseNet as the neural network
  model for machine learning process, which is more accurate than the general
  deep neural network. Using differential entropy as the main eigenvalue makes
  the system's ability to analyze emotions based on EEG more efficient.
