abstract: The purpose of this study is to develop a control method for walking
  assistive robot that enables the elderly to keep positive emotions and
  maintain high levels of motivation during exercise. In this study, a control
  method based on emotion recognition and fatigue detection was proposed. We
  used brainwave and heartbeat signals to train a deep neural network (DNN)
  model to recognize human emotions. Portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  was used to detect muscle fatigue. Furthermore, we established a 3D human
  state model to evaluate the userâ€™s emotional and fatigue states. We also
  performed experiments to evaluate the ability of the control method to improve
  the effect of walking exercise.
