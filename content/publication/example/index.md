abstract: As an observant and active thinker, I enjoy recording inspirations
  from life experiences and apply them to my later researches. For example, in
  Beijing Aquarium, I occasionally noticed a strange fish named manta ray
  swimming very differently by flapping two pectoral fins. Immediately, the idea
  of applying this unique movement to the aerial robot design stroke on me, and
  the seed of creating novel bionic robots grown in my mind ever since. After
  consulting my supervisor Prof. Zhongcai Pei, we both agreed that it was a good
  idea but also quite difficult for me to realize with only theoretical
  knowledge from the class. Thanks to my diligence and indomitable spirit, I
  designed and fabricated the prototype by devoting myself to much literature
  and collaborating with teammates. After continuous iteration and improvement,
  the aerial robot had satisfactory controlling performance. More proudly,
  because of the robot's highly competitive features (flexible material
  fuselage, low-frequency flapping wings, low noise), it was chosen and utilized
  by Beijing Air and Space Museum to take aerial photos of the anniversary
  exhibition in 2018. This was the first time my robot was used in practical
  applications, and I felt thrilled for the actual convenience and joy that
  robots can provide to our life. Beyond developing a workable robot, this
  project also enlightened me of the importance of improving the reliability and
  robustness of the system. Fortunately, I was recruited by Prof. Pei as a
  research assistant in his lab after graduation based on my ability and
  performance, enabling me to devote myself to the research of mechanical
  engineering. In this period, by learning about the latest publications and
  open-source tools, I built a better understanding of others' research work and
  thought carefully about what I wanted to do in the future.

**Mechanical design:** Designed a bionic manta ray aerial robot with a pectoral fin structure; Developed a rolling control mechanism by moving around the centre of gravity.
**Flexible wing analysis:** Measured the aerodynamic force generated by the flapping mechanism under different flexibility of the artificial wing; Further optimized the wing area and flexibility distribution.
**Indoor navigation system development:** Developed, tested and deployed a navigation system based on Ultra Wideband (UWB) indoor positioning technology.
**Market background investigation:** Investigated the general background of indoor aerial robots, including product application, competing products, business plan and fund-raising.
