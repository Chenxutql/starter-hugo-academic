abstract: Aiming at the severe requirement of landing terrain environment for
  UAVs, especially large UAVs, an adaptive landing gear is designed in this
  paper. The control system and PID controller based on attitude feedback,
  height feedback, and force feedback are designed synthetically using high
  precision force sensor, attitude sensor, and laser ranging sensor. The
  SIMULINK model is built in MATLAB and debugged in the actual system. The
  simulation and physical experiments show that the control system in this paper
  has the characteristics of good control robustness and fast response speed,
  which provides a beneficial attempt for the engineering application of
  adaptive landing gear.
