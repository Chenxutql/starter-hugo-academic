abstract: As the population ages, the number of elderly people suffering from
  systemic diseases such as stroke increases. To address this problem, various
  wearable walking assistive robots have been developed to promote physical
  exercise for stroke prevention. Wearable assistive robots have shown the
  ability to improve human mobility. However, most of these robots are heavy,
  bulky, and impractical. In this study, we developed a compact ankle assistive
  robot for elderly users to promote walking exercise. By informing the user of
  correct motion and timing, the robot can guide the user to achieve a healthy
  gait by only assisting their ankle joint. The robot provides faster-than-ankle
  motion to allow the user to feel supported while walking. Users can adjust the
  robot’s assistance parameters through a graphical user interface (GUI)
  according to their demands. Furthermore, we proposed a gait-adaptive method
  for ankle assistive robots to adapt to the user’s changing gait. Hence, the
  robot can automatically adjust the parameters to provide more accurate walking
  assistance. Finally, the results of an evaluation experiment demonstrated the
  positive feasibility of human gait adaptation. The proposed methods have the
  advantages of low cost and easy implementation.
