abstract: "As the population ages, the number of elderly suffering from systemic
  diseases such as stroke increases. To address this problem, various wearable
  walking assistive robots have been developed to promote physical exercise for
  stroke prevention. Wearable assistive robots have shown the ability to improve
  human mobility. However, most of these robots are heavy, bulky, and with poor
  practicability. In this study, we developed a compact ankle assistive robot
  for elderly users to promote walking exercise. By informing correct motion and
  timing, the robot can guide the user to achieve a healthy gait by only
  assisting their ankle joint. The robot provides faster-than-ankle motion to
  allow the user to feel facilitated during the walking. Users can adjust the
  robot’s assistance parameters through a graphical user interface (GUI)
  according to their demands. Furthermore, we proposed a gait-adaptive method
  for ankle assistive robots to adapt to the user’s changing gait. Hence, the
  robot can adjust the parameters automatically to provide more accurate walking
  assistance. Finally, the results of the evaluation experiment demonstrated the
  positive feasibility of human gait adaptation. The proposed methods have the
  advantage of being low-cost and easy to be implemented. "
