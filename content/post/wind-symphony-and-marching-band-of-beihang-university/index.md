I am convinced that becoming an excellent researcher also requires comprehensive development. Out of my love for western music, I have been studying classical saxophone for more than 15 years and was the principal saxophonist in Beihang University Wind Symphony when I was an undergraduate. In addition, years of experience in the orchestra has also cultivated my good spirit of cooperation.
