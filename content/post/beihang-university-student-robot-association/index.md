  ## Motivation:


  The desire for “Flying Through the Sea of Air” is a vision that has constantly motivated us to explore the design of aerial robots since we noticed that the manta ray swims through the water as a bird flies through the air. Most conventional aerial robots are driven by propellers. However, the use of propellers is accompanied by noise and danger due to the high-speed rotation. Once the operating propeller accidentally touches persons or objects, injury or economic loss may result, which makes the propeller-based aerial robots usually unsuitable for indoor environment application. Biomimetics in propulsion inspires us to solve the above limitation.
