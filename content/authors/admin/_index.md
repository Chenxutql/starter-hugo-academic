Mingyang Xu is currently a Master student at Waseda University, Japan. Before that, I received his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with Excellent Graduate Honor in 2019 from Beihang University, Beijing, China.

During my master studies, I work on **walking assistive robot** project under the supervision of Prof. and Dr. . Previously, I worked on **terrain-adaptive Aerial Robot** project supervised by Prof. Tianmiao Wang in Intelligent Technology and Robotics Lab (iTR) and **"iMANTA" Bionic Aerial Robot** project supervised by Prof. Jianhong Liang and Prof. Zhongcai Pei during my bachelor study.
